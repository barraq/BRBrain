BRBrain
=======

The **B**ioloid **R**emote **Brain**, developped by the [Northeastern University][], provides a firmware and a Java host library for controlling the [Bioloid][]. 
With BRBrain, Java code running on a host PC controls the Bioloid via a serial tether or a Bluetooth link.

The aim of this github repository is to centralize the code developped by the [Northeastern University][] so as to share it more easilly with the community but also to provide addionnal increments.

## BrBrain Firmware

The Firmware has been updated and now supports both CM-5 and CM-510 platforms.
