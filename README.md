BRBrain
=======

The *B*ioloid *R*emote *Brain*, developped by the [Northeastern University][http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/gpc/BRBrain/], provides a firmware and a Java host library for controlling the [Bioloid][http://www.robotis.com/xe/bioloid_en]. 
With BRBrain, Java code running on a host PC controls the Bioloid via a serial tether or a Bluetooth link.
